<h1>Hackathon Project <\h1>
Welcome to the BNCC TPM "Hackathon" Project! This web application was developed during our participation in the BNCC TPM. Our team has created a functional website that allows teams to create their own groups and sign up, while administrators can manage each of the teams. Additionally, the website contains information about previous hackathons and upcoming meetings.
